# hotel-management
first python project. In this project, user enter the number of beds they want in their room , program checks  avaliablity of room of respective number of bed, after that the user ask to pay and set a password to use later for room service all the data will be saved on file and password will be encrypted in the file so privacy will remain maintained.  As it's my first project and first try , I know I did many blunders but this is how we all learn and I am trying to learn better coding each day.
